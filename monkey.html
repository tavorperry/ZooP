			<h3>Historical and modern terminology</h3>
			<p>
			According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word "monkey" may originate in a German version of the Reynard the Fox fable, published circa 1580. In this version of the fable, a character named Moneke is the son of Martin the Ape.[7] In English, no very clear distinction was originally made between "ape" and "monkey"; thus the 1910 Encyclopædia Britannica entry for "ape" notes that it is either a synonym for "monkey" or is used to mean a tailless humanlike primate.[8] Colloquially, the terms "monkey" and "ape" are widely used interchangeably.[9] Also, a few monkey species have the word "ape" in their common name, such as the Barbary ape.
			Later in the first half of the 20th century, the idea developed that there were trends in primate evolution and that the living members of the order could be arranged in a series, leading through "monkeys" and "apes" to humans.[10] Monkeys thus constituted a "grade" on the path to humans and were distinguished from "apes".
			</p>

			<h3> Description</h3>

			<p>
				Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 millimetres (4.6 in) with a 172-millimetre (6.8 in) tail and just over 100 grams (3.5 oz) in weight,[17] to the male mandrill, almost 1 metre (3.3 ft) long and weighing up to 36 kilograms (79 lb).[18] Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders).[19]

				Some characteristics are shared among the groups; most New World monkeys have prehensile tails while Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails or no visible tail at all. Old World monkeys have trichromatic color vision like that of humans, while New World monkeys may be trichromatic, dichromatic, or—as in the owl monkeys and greater galagos—monochromatic. Although both the New and Old World monkeys, like the apes, have forward-facing eyes, the faces of Old World and New World monkeys look very different, though again, each group shares some features such as the types of noses, cheeks and rumps.[19]
			</p>

			<h3>Relationship with humans</h3>

			<p>
				The many species of monkey have varied relationships with humans. Some are kept as pets, others used as model organisms in laboratories or in space missions. They may be killed in monkey drives (when they threaten agriculture) or used as service animals for the disabled.

				In some areas, some species of monkey are considered agricultural pests, and can cause extensive damage to commercial and subsistence crops.[27] This can have important implications for the conservation of endangered species, which may be subject to persecution. In some instances farmers' perceptions of the damage may exceed the actual damage.[28] Monkeys that have become habituated to human presence in tourist locations may also be considered pests, attacking tourists.[29]

				In religion and popular culture, monkeys are a symbol of playfulness, mischief and fun.

			</p>

			<h3>Religion and worship</h3>

			<p>
				Hanuman, a prominent divine entity in Hinduism, is a human-like monkey god. He bestows courage, strength and longevity to the person who thinks about him or the god Rama.

				In Buddhism, the monkey is an early incarnation of Buddha but may also represent trickery and ugliness. The Chinese Buddhist "mind monkey" metaphor refers to the unsettled, restless state of human mind. Monkey is also one of the Three Senseless Creatures, symbolizing greed, with the tiger representing anger and the deer lovesickness.

				The Sanzaru, or three wise monkeys, are revered in Japanese folklore, together they embody the proverbial principle to "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil".[37]

				The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature.[38] They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted monkeys in their art.[39]

				The Tzeltal people of Mexico worshipped monkeys as incarnations of their dead ancestors.
