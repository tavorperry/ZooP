			<h3>General information</h3>
			<p>
				The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the Felidae family and a member of the genus Panthera. 
				It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996, as populations in African range countries declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. 
				Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern.[2] 
				The West African lion population is listed as Critically Endangered since 2016.[4] The only lion population in Asia survives in and around India's Gir Forest National Park and is listed as Endangered since 1986.[5]
			</p>
			<h3>Etymology</h3>
			<p>
				The lion's name, similar in many Romance languages, is derived from the Latin leo,[13] and the Ancient Greek λέων (leon).[14] The Hebrew word לָבִיא ('lavi') may also be related.[15] 
				It was one of the species originally described by Linnaeus, who gave it the name Felis leo, in his eighteenth-century work, Systema Naturae.[3]
			</p>
			<h3>Taxonomy and evolution</h3>
			<p>
				The lion's closest relatives are the other species of the genus Panthera: the tiger, the snow leopard, the jaguar, and the leopard. Studies from 2006 and 2009 concluded that the jaguar is a sister species to the lion and the leopard is a sister taxon to the jaguar/lion clade[16][17] while 2010 and 2011 studies have swapped the positions leopard and jaguar.[18][19] P. leo evolved in Africa between 1 million and 800,000 years ago, before spreading throughout the Holarctic region.[20] It appeared in the fossil record in Europe for the first time 700,000 years ago with the subspecies Panthera leo fossilis at Isernia in Italy. From this lion derived the later cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea),[21] which appeared about 300,000 years ago. Lions died out in northern Eurasia at the end of the last glaciation, about 10,000 years ago; this may have been secondary to the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna.[22][23]
			</p>
			<h3>Characteristics</h3>
			<p>
				Lions are muscular, deep-chested felids with short, rounded heads, reduced necks and round ears.[59] Of the living, non-hybrid felids, the lion is second only to the tiger in length and weight. Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, with a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than that of a tiger. However, due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.[55][56][60] Lion colouration varies from light buff to silverly gray, to yellowish red and dark brown.[59] The underparts are generally lighter and cubs are born with dark spots on their body. The spots fade as lions reach adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts.[61]
